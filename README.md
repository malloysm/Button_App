# Button_App
In this project an App was created for Windows Phone 8 using Visual Studio. The app is just a simple button that makes some text appear, and a toggle switch that does the same.

The 2013 version of Visual Studio + Windows Phone 8 SDK is available here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/
A Microsoft account and developer's license are required (both free).
How to open the Windows Phone 8 template with Visual C#: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/windows-phone-8-creating-your-first-application--mobile-21175
The XAML Button description: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.button

Note: I could not get the designer or phone emulator to work on my Windows 10 PC, but it is not necessary as long as you have a physical device to test on. To deploy to the phone it must be connected to the computer and opened on home screen.
